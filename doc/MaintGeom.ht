</A><P>
<B>Tk_MaintainGeometry</B> and <B>Tk_UnmaintainGeometry</B> make it<BR>
easier for geometry managers to deal with slaves whose masters are not<BR>
their parents.<BR>
Three problems arise if the master for a slave is not its parent:<BR>
<DL>
<DT>(a)
<DD>The x- and y-position of the slave must be translated from the<BR>
coordinate system of the master to that of the parent before<BR>
positioning the slave.<BR>
<DT>(b)
<DD>If the master window, or any of its ancestors up to the slave's<BR>
parent, is moved, then the slave must be repositioned within its<BR>
parent in order to maintain the correct position relative to the<BR>
master.<BR>
<DT>(c)
<DD>If the master or one of its ancestors is mapped or unmapped, then<BR>
the slave must be mapped or unmapped to correspond.<BR>
</DL>
<P>
None of these problems is an issue if the parent and master are<BR>
the same.  For example, if the master or one of its ancestors<BR>
is unmapped, the slave is automatically removed by the screen<BR>
by X.<BR>
<P>
<B>Tk_MaintainGeometry</B> deals with these problems for slaves<BR>
whose masters aren't their parents.<BR>
<B>Tk_MaintainGeometry</B> is typically called by a window manager<BR>
once it has decided where a slave should be positioned relative<BR>
to its master.<BR>
<B>Tk_MaintainGeometry</B> translates the coordinates to the<BR>
coordinate system of <I>slave</I>'s parent and then moves and<BR>
resizes the slave appropriately.<BR>
Furthermore, it remembers the desired position and creates event<BR>
handlers to monitor the master and all of its ancestors up<BR>
to (but not including) the slave's parent.<BR>
If any of these windows is moved, mapped, or unmapped,<BR>
the slave will be adjusted so that it is mapped only when the<BR>
master is mapped and its geometry relative to the master<BR>
remains as specified by <I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, <I>width</I>, and<BR>
<I>height</I>.<BR>
<P>
When a window manager relinquishes control over a window, or<BR>
if it decides that it does not want the window to appear on the<BR>
screen under any conditions, it calls <B>Tk_UnmaintainGeometry</B>.<BR>
<B>Tk_UnmaintainGeometry</B> unmaps the window and cancels any<BR>
previous calls to <B>Tk_MaintainGeometry</B> for the<BR>
<I>master</I>-<I>slave</I> pair, so that the slave's<BR>
geometry and mapped state are no longer maintained<BR>
automatically.<BR>
<B>Tk_UnmaintainGeometry</B> need not be called by a geometry<BR>
manager if the slave, the master, or any of the master's ancestors<BR>
is destroyed:  Tk will call it automatically.<BR>
<P>
If <B>Tk_MaintainGeometry</B> is called repeatedly for the same<BR>
<I>master</I>-<I>slave</I> pair, the information from the most<BR>
recent call supersedes any older information.<BR>
If <B>Tk_UnmaintainGeometry</B> is called for a <I>master</I>-<I>slave</I><BR>
pair that is isn't currently managed, the call has no effect.<BR>
