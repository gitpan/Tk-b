</A><P>
In general, a window should never set its own position;  this should be<BR>
done only by the geometry manger that is responsible for the window.<BR>
For top-level windows the window manager is effectively the geometry<BR>
manager;  Tk provides interface code between the application and the<BR>
window manager to convey the application's desires to the geometry<BR>
manager.  The desired size for a top-level window is conveyed using<BR>
the usual <B>Tk_GeometryRequest</B> mechanism.  The procedure<BR>
<B>Tk_MoveToplevelWindow</B> may be used by an application to request<BR>
a particular position for a top-level window;  this procedure is<BR>
similar in function to the <B>wm geometry</B> Tcl command except that<BR>
negative offsets cannot be specified.  It is invoked by widgets such as<BR>
menus that want to appear at a particular place on the screen.<BR>
<P>
When <B>Tk_MoveToplevelWindow</B> is called it doesn't immediately<BR>
pass on the new desired location to the window manager;  it defers<BR>
this action until all other outstanding work has been completed,<BR>
using the <B>Tk_DoWhenIdle</B> mechanism.<BR>
