<HR>

<A NAME=DESCRIPTION><H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
</A>This manual entry describes the common configuration options supported
by widgets in the Tk toolkit.  Every widget does not necessarily support
every option (see the manual entries for individual widgets for a list
of the standard options supported by that widget), but if a widget does
support an option with one of the names listed below, then the option
has exactly the effect described below.
<P>
In the descriptions below,
``Name'' refers to the option's name in the option database (e.g.
in .Xdefaults files).  ``Class'' refers to the option's class value
in the option database.  ``Command-Line Switch'' refers to the
switch used in widget-creation and <B>configure</B> widget commands to
set this value.  For example, if an option's command-line switch is
<B>-foreground</B> and there exists a widget <B>.a.b.c</B>, then the
command
<BR>
<PRE>
<B>.a.b.c  configure  -foreground black</B><BR>
<BR>
</PRE>
may be used to specify the value <B>black</B> for the option in the
the widget <B>.a.b.c</B>.  Command-line switches may be abbreviated,
as long as the abbreviation is unambiguous.

<DT>Name:	<B>activeBackground</B>

<DD><DT>Class:	<B>Foreground</B>

<DD><DT>Command-Line Switch:	<B>-activebackground</B>

<DD><BR>
Specifies background color to use when drawing active elements.
An element (a widget or portion of a widget) is active if the
mouse cursor is positioned over the element and pressing a mouse button
will cause some action to occur.
If strict Motif compliance has been requested by setting the
<B>tk_strictMotif</B> variable, this option will normally be
ignored;  the normal background color will be used instead.

<DT>Name:	<B>activeBorderWidth</B>

<DD><DT>Class:	<B>BorderWidth</B>

<DD><DT>Command-Line Switch:	<B>-activeborderwidth</B>

<DD><BR>
Specifies a non-negative value indicating
the width of the 3-D border drawn around active elements.  
See above for definition of active elements.
The value may have any of the forms acceptable to <B>Tk_GetPixels</B>.
This option is typically only available in widgets displaying more
than one element at a time (e.g. menus but not buttons).

<DD><DT>Command-Line Switch:	<B>-bitmap</B>

<DD><BR>
Specifies a bitmap to display in the widget, in any of the forms
acceptable to <B>Tk_GetBitmap</B>.
The exact way in which the bitmap is displayed may be affected by
other options such as <B>anchor</B> or <B>justify</B>.
Typically, if this option is specified then it overrides other
options that specify a textual value to display in the widget;
the <B>bitmap</B> option may be reset to an empty string to re-enable
a text display.
In widgets that support both <B>bitmap</B> and <B>image</B> options,
<B>image</B> will usually override <B>bitmap</B>.

<DT>Name:	<B>borderWidth</B>

<DD><DT>Class:	<B>BorderWidth</B>

<DD><DT>Command-Line Switch:	<B>-borderwidth or -bd</B>

<DD><BR>
Specifies a non-negative value indicating the width
of the 3-D border to draw around the outside of the widget (if such a
border is being drawn;  the <B>relief</B> option typically determines
this).  The value may also be used when drawing 3-D effects in the
interior of the widget.
The value may have any of the forms acceptable to <B>Tk_GetPixels</B>.

<DD><DT>Class:	<B>DisabledForeground</B>

<DD><DT>Command-Line Switch:	<B>-disabledforeground</B>

<DD><BR>
Specifies foreground color to use when drawing a disabled element.
If the option is specified as an empty string (which is typically the
case on monochrome displays), disabled elements are drawn with the
normal fooreground color but they are dimmed by drawing them
with a stippled fill pattern.

<DT>Name:	<B>exportSelection</B>

<DD><DT>Class:	<B>ExportSelection</B>

<DD><DT>Command-Line Switch:	<B>-exportselection</B>

<DD><BR>
Specifies whether or not a selection in the widget should also be
the X selection.
The value may have any of the forms accepted by <B>Tcl_GetBoolean</B>,
such as <B>true</B>, <B>false</B>, <B>0</B>, <B>1</B>, <B>yes</B>, or <B>no</B>.
If the selection is exported, then selecting in the widget deselects
the current X selection, selecting outside the widget deselects any
widget selection, and the widget will respond to selection retrieval
requests when it has a selection.  The default is usually for widgets
to export selections.

<DD><DT>Command-Line Switch:	<B>-geometry</B>

<DD><BR>
Specifies the desired geometry for the widget's window, in the
form <I>width</I><B>x</B><I>height</I>, where <I>width</I> is the desired
width of the window and <I>height</I> is the desired height.  The
units for <I>width</I> and <I>height</I> depend on the particular
widget.  For widgets displaying text the units are usually the
size of the characters in the font being displayed;  for other
widgets the units are usually pixels.

<DD><DT>Command-Line Switch:	<B>-image</B>

<DD><BR>
Specifies an image to display in the widget, which must have been
created with the <B>image create</B> command.
Typically, if the <B>image</B> option is specified then it overrides other
options that specify a bitmap or textual value to display in the widget;
the <B>image</B> option may be reset to an empty string to re-enable
a bitmap or text display.

<DL>
<DT>Name:	<B>jump</B>

<DD><DT>Class:	<B>Jump</B>

<DD><DT>Command-Line Switch:	<B>-jump</B>

<DD><BR>
For widgets with a slider that can be dragged to adjust a value,
such as scrollbars and scales, this option determines when
notifications are made about changes in the value.
The option's value must be a boolean of the form accepted by
<B>Tcl_GetBoolean</B>.
If the value is false, updates are made continuously as the
slider is dragged.
If the value is true, updates are delayed until the mouse button
is released to end the drag;  at that point a single notification
is made (the value ``jumps'' rather than changing smoothly).
</DL>
<P>
<BR>
<DL>
<DT>Name:	<B>justify</B>

<DD><DT>Class:	<B>Justify</B>

<DD><DT>Command-Line Switch:	<B>-justify</B>

<DD><BR>
When there are multiple lines of text displayed in a widget, this
option determines how the lines line up with each other.
Must be one of <B>left</B>, <B>center</B>, or <B>right</B>.
<B>Left</B> means that the lines' left edges all line up, <B>center</B>
means that the lines' centers are aligned, and <B>right</B> means
that the lines' right edges line up.
</DL>
<P>

<DL>
<DT>Name:	<B>orient</B>

<DD><DT>Class:	<B>Orient</B>

<DD><DT>Command-Line Switch:	<B>-orient</B>

<DD><BR>
For widgets that can lay themselves out with either a horizontal
or vertical orientation, such as scrollbars, this option specifies
which orientation should be used.  Must be either <B>horizontal</B>
or <B>vertical</B> or an abbreviation of one of these.
</DL>

<DL>
<DT>Name:	<B>padX</B>

<DD><DT>Class:	<B>Pad</B>

<DD><DT>Command-Line Switch:	<B>-padx</B>

<DD><BR>
Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra space
to request for the widget in the X-direction.
The value may have any of the forms acceptable to <B>Tk_GetPixels</B>.
When computing how large a window it needs, the widget will
add this amount to the width it would normally need (as determined
by the width of the things displayed in the widget);  if the geometry
manager can satisfy this request, the widget will end up with extra
internal space to the left and/or right of what it displays inside.
Most widgets only use this option for padding text:  if they are
displaying a bitmap or image, then they usually ignore padding
options.
</DL>
<P>
<BR>
<DL>
<DT>Name:	<B>padY</B>

<DD><DT>Class:	<B>Pad</B>

<DD><DT>Command-Line Switch:	<B>-pady</B>

<DD><BR>
Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra space
to request for the widget in the Y-direction.
The value may have any of the forms acceptable to <B>Tk_GetPixels</B>.
When computing how large a window it needs, the widget will add
this amount to the height it would normally need (as determined by
the height of the things displayed in the widget);  if the geometry
manager can satisfy this request, the widget will end up with extra
internal space above and/or below what it displays inside.
Most widgets only use this option for padding text:  if they are
displaying a bitmap or image, then they usually ignore padding
options.

<DT>Name:	<B>relief</B>

<DD><DT>Class:	<B>Relief</B>

<DD><DT>Command-Line Switch:	<B>-relief</B>

<DD><BR>
Specifies the 3-D effect desired for the widget.  Acceptable
values are <B>raised</B>, <B>sunken</B>, <B>flat</B>, <B>ridge</B>,
and <B>groove</B>.
The value
indicates how the interior of the widget should appear relative
to its exterior;  for example, <B>raised</B> means the interior of
the widget should appear to protrude from the screen, relative to
the exterior of the widget.

<DT>Name:	<B>setGrid</B>

<DD><DT>Class:	<B>SetGrid</B>

<DD><DT>Command-Line Switch:	<B>-setgrid</B>

<DD><BR>
Specifies a boolean value that determines whether this widget controls the
resizing grid for its top-level window.
This option is typically used in text widgets, where the information
in the widget has a natural size (the size of a character) and it makes
sense for the window's dimensions to be integral numbers of these units.
These natural window sizes form a grid.
If the <B>setGrid</B> option is set to true then the widget will
communicate with the window manager so that when the user interactively
resizes the top-level window that contains the widget, the dimensions of
the window will be displayed to the user in grid units and the window
size will be constrained to integral numbers of grid units.
See the section GRIDDED GEOMETRY MANAGEMENT in the <B>wm</B> manual
entry for more details.

<BR>
<DL>
<DT>Name:	<B>takeFocus</B>

<DD><DT>Class:	<B>TakeFocus</B>

<DD><DT>Command-Line Switch:	<B>-takefocus</B>

<DD><BR>
Provides information used when moving the focus from window to window
via keyboard traversal (e.g., Tab and Shift-Tab).
Before setting the focus to a window, the traversal scripts first
check whether the window is viewable (it and all its ancestors are mapped);
if not, the window is skipped.
Next, the scripts consult the value of the <B>takeFocus</B> option.
A value of <B>0</B> means that this window should be skipped entirely
during keyboard traversal. 
<B>1</B> means that the this window should always receive the input
focus.
An empty value means that the traversal scripts make the decision
about whether or not to focus on the window:  the current
algorithm is to skip the window if it is
disabled or if it has no key bindings.
If the value has any other form, then the traversal scripts take
the value, append the name of the window to it (with a separator space),
and evaluate the resulting string as a Tcl script.
The script must return 0, 1, or an empty string;  this value is used
just as if the option had that value in the first place.
Note: this interpretation of the option is defined entirely by
the Tcl scripts that implement traversal:  the widget implementations
ignore the option entirely, so you can change its meaning if you
redefine the keyboard traversal scripts.

<DT>Name:	<B>text</B>

<DD><DT>Class:	<B>Text</B>

<DD><DT>Command-Line Switch:	<B>-text</B>

<DD><BR>
Specifies a string to be displayed inside the widget.  The way in which
the string is displayed depends on the particular widget and may be
determined by other options, such as <B>anchor</B> or <B>justify</B>.

<DT>Name:	<B>textVariable</B>

<DD><DT>Class:	<B>Variable</B>

<DD><DT>Command-Line Switch:	<B>-textvariable</B>

<DD><BR>
Specifies the name of a variable.  The value of the variable is a text
string to be displayed inside the widget;  if the variable value changes
then the widget will automatically update itself to reflect the new value.
The way in which the string is displayed in the widget depends on the
particular widget and may be determined by other options, such as
<B>anchor</B> or <B>justify</B>.

<DT>Name:	<B>underline</B>

<DD><DT>Class:	<B>Underline</B>

<DD><DT>Command-Line Switch:	<B>-underline</B>

<DD><BR>
Specifies the integer index of a character to underline in the widget.
This option is used by the default bindings to implement keyboard
traversal for menu buttons and menu entries.
0 corresponds to the first character of the text displayed in the
widget, 1 to the next character, and so on.

<DT>Name:	<B>wrapLength</B>

<DD><DT>Class:	<B>WrapLength</B>

<DD><DT>Command-Line Switch:	<B>-wraplength</B>

<DD><BR>
For widgets that can perform word-wrapping, this option specifies
the maximum line length.
Lines that would exceed this length are wrapped onto the next line,
so that no line is longer than the specified length.
The value may be specified in any of the standard forms for
screen distances.
If this value is less than or equal to 0 then no wrapping is done:  lines
will break only at newline characters in the text.

<DT>Name:	<B>xScrollCommand</B>

<DD><DT>Class:	<B>ScrollCommand</B>

<DD><DT>Command-Line Switch:	<B>-xscrollcommand</B>

<DD><BR>
Specifies the prefix for a command used to communicate with horizontal
scrollbars.
When the view in the widget's window changes (or
whenever anything else occurs that could change the display in a
scrollbar, such as a change in the total size of the widget's
contents), the widget will
generate a Tcl command by concatenating the scroll command and
two numbers.
Each of the numbers is a fraction between 0 and 1, which indicates
a position in the document.  0 indicates the beginning of the document,
1 indicates the end, .333 indicates a position one third the way through
the document, and so on.
The first fraction indicates the first information in the document
that is visible in the window, and the second fraction indicates
the information just after the last portion that is visible.
The command is
then passed to the Tcl interpreter for execution.  Typically the
<B>xScrollCommand</B> option consists of the path name of a scrollbar
widget followed by ``set'', e.g. ``.x.scrollbar set'':  this will cause
the scrollbar to be updated whenever the view in the window changes.
If this option is not specified, then no command will be executed.

Specifies the prefix for a command used to communicate with vertical
scrollbars.  This option is treated in the same way as the
<B>xScrollCommand</B> option, except that it is used for vertical
scrollbars and is provided by widgets that support vertical scrolling.
See the description of <B>xScrollCommand</B> for details
on how this option is used.
