</A><P>
This command provides a Tcl interface to the Tk clipboard,
which stores data for later retrieval using the selection mechanism.
In order to copy data into the clipboard, <B>clipboard clear</B> must
be called, followed by a sequence of one or more calls to <B>clipboard</B>
append.  To ensure that the clipboard is updated atomically, all
appends should be completed before returning to the event loop.
<P>
The first argument to <B>clipboard</B> determines the format of the
rest of the arguments and the behavior of the command.  The following
forms are currently supported:
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>clipboard clear</B> ?<B>-displayof</B> <I>window</I>?

<DD>Claims ownership of the clipboard on <I>window</I>'s display and removes
any previous contents.  <I>Window</I> defaults to ``.''.  Returns an
empty string.
<DT><B>clipboard append</B> ?<B>-displayof</B> <I>window</I>? ?<B>-format</B> <I>format</I>? ?<B>-type</B> <I>type</I>? ?<B>--</B>? <I>data</I>

<DD>Appends <I>data</I> to the clipboard on <I>window</I>'s
display in the form given by <I>type</I> with the representation given
by <I>format</I> and claims ownership of the clipboard on <I>window</I>'s
display.
<DL>
<P>
<I>Type</I> specifies the form in which the selection is to be returned
(the desired ``target'' for conversion, in ICCCM terminology), and
should be an atom name such as STRING or FILE_NAME; see the
Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual for complete details.
<I>Type</I> defaults to STRING.
<P>
The <I>format</I> argument specifies the representation that should be
used to transmit the selection to the requester (the second column of
Table 2 of the ICCCM), and defaults to STRING.  If <I>format</I> is
STRING, the selection is transmitted as 8-bit ASCII characters.  If
<I>format</I> is ATOM, then the <I>data</I> is
divided into fields separated by white space; each field is converted
to its atom value, and the 32-bit atom value is transmitted instead of
the atom name.  For any other <I>format</I>,  <I>data</I> is divided
into fields separated by white space and each 
field is converted to a 32-bit integer; an array of integers is
transmitted to the selection requester.  Note that strings passed to
<B>clipboard append</B> are concatenated before conversion, so the
caller must take care to ensure appropriate spacing across string
boundaries.  All items appended to the clipboard with the same
<I>type</I> must have the same <I>format</I>.
<P>
The <I>format</I> argument is needed only for compatibility with
clipboard requesters that don't use Tk.  If the Tk toolkit is being
used to retrieve the CLIPBOARD selection then the value is converted back to
a string at the requesting end, so <I>format</I> is
irrelevant.
<P>
A <B>--</B> argument may be specified to mark the end of options:  the
next argument will always be used as <I>data</I>.
This feature may be convenient if, for example, <I>data</I> starts
with a <B>-</B>.
